# Clean Architecture Project Structure Analysis

This appears to be a .NET solution implementing Clean Architecture principles, organized in a well-structured layered approach. Here's a technical breakdown of the main components:

## Core Layers
- `CleanArchitecture.Application`: Contains application business logic and use cases
- `CleanArchitecture.Domain`: Houses domain entities, aggregates, and business rules

## Infrastructure Layer
Located under `Infrastructure` folder:
- `Context`: Contains data context implementation (`DataContext.cs`)
- `Repositories`: Implements repository pattern
 - `BaseRepository.cs`: Base repository implementation
 - `ProductRepository.cs`: Product-specific repository  
 - `UnitOfWork.cs`: Implements Unit of Work pattern
- `ServiceExtensions.cs`: Extension methods for service configuration

## Presentation Layer
WebAPI project containing:
- `Controllers`: API endpoints (includes `ProductsController.cs`)
- `Extensions`:
 - `ApiBehaviorExtensions.cs`: Custom API behavior configurations
 - `CorsPolicyExtensions.cs`: CORS policy settings 
 - `FilterHandlerExtensions.cs`: Request/Response filter handlers

## Configuration
- `appsettings.json`: Application configuration
- `Dockerfile`: Container configuration
- `Program.cs`: Application entry point
- `WebApi.http`: HTTP request definitions

This structure follows SOLID principles and separation of concerns, making the codebase maintainable and testable. The layered architecture ensures clear boundaries between different responsibilities within the application.
